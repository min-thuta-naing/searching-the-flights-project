## 🔌 Database Connection

### Connect to Database

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
& "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin\psql.exe" -U postgres -d flight_search

# macOS/Linux
psql -U postgres -d flight_search
```

### Basic Connection Commands

```sql
-- List all databases
\l

-- Connect to flight_search database
\c flight_search

-- List all tables
\dt

-- Describe table structure
\d table_name

-- List all extensions
\dx

-- Exit psql
\q
```

---

## ✅ Data Verification

### Check All Tables

```sql
-- Count records in all tables
SELECT 
  'airlines' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM airlines
UNION ALL
SELECT 'routes', COUNT(*) FROM routes
UNION ALL
SELECT 'flight_prices', COUNT(*) FROM flight_prices
UNION ALL
SELECT 'weather_statistics', COUNT(*) FROM weather_statistics
UNION ALL
SELECT 'holiday_statistics', COUNT(*) FROM holiday_statistics
UNION ALL
SELECT 'thai_holidays', COUNT(*) FROM thai_holidays
UNION ALL
SELECT 'demand_statistics', COUNT(*) FROM demand_statistics
UNION ALL
SELECT 'search_statistics', COUNT(*) FROM search_statistics;
```

### Airlines

```sql
-- List all airlines
SELECT * FROM airlines ORDER BY code;

-- Count airlines
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM airlines;
-- Expected: 6 airlines (TG, FD, SL, VZ, PG, DD)

-- Check specific airline
SELECT * FROM airlines WHERE code = 'TG';
```

### Routes

```sql
-- List all routes
SELECT 
  id,
  origin,
  destination,
  distance_km,
  duration_minutes
FROM routes
ORDER BY origin, destination;

-- Count routes by origin
SELECT 
  origin, 
  COUNT(*) as route_count
FROM routes
GROUP BY origin
ORDER BY route_count DESC;

-- Expected: 31 routes (BKK to all other provinces)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM routes WHERE origin = 'BKK';
```

### Flight Prices

```sql
-- Count total flight prices
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flight_prices;
-- Expected: ~130,000-140,000 records

-- Check date range
SELECT 
  MIN(departure_date) as earliest_date,
  MAX(departure_date) as latest_date,
  COUNT(*) as total_flights
FROM flight_prices;

-- Count flights by route
SELECT 
  r.origin,
  r.destination,
  COUNT(*) as flight_count,
  MIN(fp.price) as min_price,
  MAX(fp.price) as max_price,
  AVG(fp.price)::DECIMAL(10,2) as avg_price
FROM routes r
LEFT JOIN flight_prices fp ON r.id = fp.route_id
GROUP BY r.id, r.origin, r.destination
ORDER BY flight_count DESC;

-- Check flights for specific route
SELECT 
  fp.departure_date,
  fp.return_date,
  fp.price,
  fp.trip_type,
  a.name as airline,
  r.origin || ' -> ' || r.destination as route
FROM flight_prices fp
JOIN routes r ON fp.route_id = r.id
JOIN airlines a ON fp.airline_id = a.id
WHERE r.origin = 'BKK' AND r.destination = 'CNX'
ORDER BY fp.departure_date
LIMIT 20;

-- Check price distribution by month
SELECT 
  TO_CHAR(departure_date, 'YYYY-MM') as month,
  COUNT(*) as flights,
  MIN(price) as min_price,
  MAX(price) as max_price,
  AVG(price)::DECIMAL(10,2) as avg_price
FROM flight_prices fp
JOIN routes r ON fp.route_id = r.id
WHERE r.origin = 'BKK' AND r.destination = 'CNX'
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(departure_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY month;
```

## 🗑️ Data Cleanup

### ⚠️ CAUTION: These commands will DELETE data!

### Clear Flight Prices Only

```sql
-- Clear all flight prices (keeps routes and airlines)
TRUNCATE TABLE flight_prices;

-- Clear flight prices for specific route
DELETE FROM flight_prices 
WHERE route_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM routes 
  WHERE origin = 'BKK' AND destination = 'CNX'
);

-- Clear old flight prices (older than 90 days)
DELETE FROM flight_prices 
WHERE departure_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days';

-- Clear future flight prices (beyond 1 year)
DELETE FROM flight_prices 
WHERE departure_date > CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '1 year';
```

### Clear Routes and Flight Prices

```sql
-- Clear all routes and related flight prices
TRUNCATE TABLE routes, flight_prices CASCADE;

-- Clear specific route
DELETE FROM routes WHERE origin = 'BKK' AND destination = 'CNX';
-- Flight prices will be deleted automatically (CASCADE)
```

### Clear All Mock Data

```sql
-- Clear all flight-related data (keeps airlines)
TRUNCATE TABLE flight_prices, routes CASCADE;

-- Verify
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flight_prices; -- Should be 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM routes; -- Should be 0
```

### Clear Statistics Tables

```sql
-- Clear weather statistics
TRUNCATE TABLE weather_statistics;

-- Clear holiday statistics
TRUNCATE TABLE holiday_statistics;

-- Clear demand statistics
TRUNCATE TABLE demand_statistics;

-- Clear search statistics
TRUNCATE TABLE search_statistics;
```

### Reset Entire Database

```sql
-- ⚠️ DANGER: This will delete ALL data including airlines and holidays!
TRUNCATE TABLE 
  airlines,
  routes,
  flight_prices,
  weather_statistics,
  holiday_statistics,
  demand_statistics,
  search_statistics,
  thai_holidays
CASCADE;

-- Verify all tables are empty
SELECT 
  'airlines' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM airlines
UNION ALL
SELECT 'routes', COUNT(*) FROM routes
UNION ALL
SELECT 'flight_prices', COUNT(*) FROM flight_prices;
```

### Drop and Recreate Database (Nuclear Option)

```bash
# ⚠️ EXTREME CAUTION: Deletes everything!
psql -U postgres -c "DROP DATABASE flight_search;"
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE flight_search;"
psql -U postgres -d flight_search -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;"

# Then re-run all migrations
cd backend
npm run migrate
```
